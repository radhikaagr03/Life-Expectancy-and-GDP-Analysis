# Life Expectancy and GDP Analysis

### Purpose:
This project seeks to answer key questions related to the relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy, focusing on both the year 2007 and changes over time by continent. The primary goal is to gain insights into how economic factors influence life expectancy and whether there are consistent trends across different continents.

### Data:
The analysis is based on the STAT-S 670 Mini Project dataset, which includes comprehensive information on GDP per capita, life expectancy, and other relevant variables for various countries over a specified period.

### Analysis Overview:

#### Section 1: GDP and Life Expectancy in 2007
1.1. **How does life expectancy vary with GDP per capita in 2007?**
   - Explore the non-linear relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy, emphasizing the need for logarithmic transformation.

1.2. **Is the pattern the same or different for every continent?**
   - Investigate whether the observed trends are consistent across continents, identifying variations in the rate of increase and specific patterns for each.

1.3. **Can differences between continents be simply described by an additive or multiplicative shift?**
   - Examine the complexity of differences between continents, determining whether a simple additive or multiplicative shift can adequately explain variations.

#### Section 2: Life Expectancy over Time by Continent
2.1. **Has average life expectancy changed over time in each continent?**
   - Analyze changes in average life expectancy over time, considering different rates of increase for each continent.

2.2. **Have some continents caught up (at least partially) to others?**
   - Investigate instances of convergence in life expectancy trends among continents, considering whether specific countries drive these changes.

2.3. **Have the changes been linear, or has it been faster/slower in some periods for some continents?**
   - Explore the linearity of changes in life expectancy over time, identifying periods of faster or slower improvement and potential influencing factors.

2.4. **What might explain periods of faster/slower change?**
   - Examine factors contributing to variations in the rate of change in life expectancy, including population dynamics, GDP per capita, and external influences.

#### Section 3: Changes in the Relationship between GDP and Life Expectancy over Time
3.1. **How has the relationship between GDP and life expectancy changed in each continent?**
   - Analyze scatter plots over time, evaluating how the relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy evolves for each continent.

3.2. **Can changes in life expectancy be entirely explained by changes in GDP per capita?**
   - Investigate the correlation matrix to understand the contribution of GDP per capita and other variables to changes in life expectancy.

3.3. **Has there been “convergence” in the sense that perhaps GDP and/or continent don’t matter as much as it used to?**
   - Explore the concept of convergence over time, identifying similarities and exceptions to general patterns in the relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy.

### Key Insights:
- The relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy is non-linear, often requiring logarithmic transformation.
- Trends and rates of increase in life expectancy vary across continents.
- External factors, such as technological advancements and political/social influences, play a significant role in shaping life expectancy trends.
- Evidence of convergence in the relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy, but exceptions exist.

### Conclusion:
The project concludes that while increases in GDP per capita are associated with higher life expectancy, the relationship is complex and influenced by external factors. Understanding these dynamics provides valuable insights into the varying trends in life expectancy across continents and over time.
